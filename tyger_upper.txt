           THE TYGER
TYGER! TYGER! BURNING BRIGHT
WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE
COULD FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY?
BURNT THE FIRE OF THINE EYES?
COULD TWIST THE SINEWS OF THY HEART?
AND WHEN THY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT,
IN WHAT FURNACE WAS THY BRAIN?
DARE ITS DEADLY TERRORS CLASP?
TYGER! TYGER! BURNING BRIGHT
WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE
DARE FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY?
                    BY WILLIAM BLAKE
